:tada: Welcome to the Noodles repository :tada:

We really appreciate your interest in our project and we would :heart: your contributions!

## About
The Noodles is a open-source project


### How it works
The platform functions similar to a wiki but uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) instead; hosting the raw _files_ at [https://github.com/DIYbiosphere/sphere](https://github.com/DIYbiosphere/sphere) and rendering _webpages_ at [http://sphere.diybio.org](http://sphere.diybio.org)

Each DIYbio initiative has its own entry which are organized into eight collections: _projects_, _startups_, _labs_, _incubators_, _groups_, _networks_, _events_, and _others_. An entry is added by creating its own folder in its respective collection, and adding a _text file in markdown syntax_ with a _YAML front matter_, which is then rendered into its webpage. For example, the file `_projects/MyDIYbioProject/MyDIYbioProject.md` could look like this:

```yaml
---
# This is the front matter in YAML; between two lines of three consecutive dashes (---)
title: My DIYbio Project
start-date: 2000
type-org: non-profit
website: http://my-diybio-project.io
tags:
  - open hardware
  - citizen science
---
# This is the text in Markdown syntax; after the front matter

My DIYbio project is about **open hardware** and **citizen science**.

```

The _front matter_ includes several `key: value` pairs that render into different elements in the webpage. The `Avocado Lab` is an example entry for pedagogical purposes. You can check out the raw file [raw file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIYbiosphere/sphere/master/docs/tutorials/AvocadoLab/AvocadoLab.md) rendered into [this webpage](http://sphere.diybio.org/docs/tutorials/AvocadoLab). See the rendered image below, and by its side the different elements of the page labeled.
